=====

In the test folder, there is an Android Test Project. Importing the main project into Eclipse will also import the test project and largely set everything up for you. However because eclipse project files are gitignored you have to edit the java build path for the test project to include the dependecy on the main project. 

The appropriate setting can be found under Project Properties>Java Build Path>Projects
